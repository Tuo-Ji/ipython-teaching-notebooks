Notes, slides and data from the Python Bootcamp
-----------------------------------------------

These are the materials from two hour-long tutorials I ran during the 2012 Pythong Bootcamp at UC Berkeley. 

bootcamp-scipy
  A lecture introducing SciPy (slides as pdf) and an IPython notebook giving worked examples of the functionality. Also includes: an introducting into wrapping Fortran code with f2py and an example.f90 subroutine; a Matlab data structure (testbox.mat) to demonstrate the scipy.io module and NumPy's ndarray.

bootcamp-scientificprogramming
  A lecture on broader scientific programming themes in Python. The slides introduce the SciPy packages and three problems that use scipy.optimize, scipy.integrate, scipy.interpolate, scipy.linalg and scipy.fftpack. The problems are detailed in three notebooks (SciPyProblems_*.ipynb), for which corresponding solution notebooks (SciPyAnswers_*.ipynb) are provided. The data sets used in these problems are also included. 


Materials for the *Python Computing for Science* UC Berkeley course
-------------------------------------------------------------------

AY250-scikits.statsmodels
  Material for the latter part of Lecture 4 of `this`_ graduate course (from 2:16:40 onward in the webcast). Includes slides from the lecture, the IPython notebook used to demonstrate the material and an EEG data set used in the presentation.
